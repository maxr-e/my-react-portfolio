# my-react-portfolio
I rebuilt my portfolio using React.
Getting my new laptop up to speed. So far, I've installed node.js. Then ```npm i``` in bash.
Now that the app is actually initializing, I am chewing through errors. Resolved import errors with react and 'useState'. Updated react-dom with a const=root change in index.js.
useState was utilized
10/22/23 I need to set up a server! It's been so long since I worked this repo I totally forgot where I was. Using "Issues" in GitHub.com would help keep tasks straight. Also having more experience and doing this over and over and over would help!
