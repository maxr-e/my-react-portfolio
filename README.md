# my-react-portfolio
I rebuilt my portfolio using React.
Getting my new laptop up to speed. So far, I've installed node.js. Then ```npm i``` in bash.
Now that the app is actually initializing, I am chewing through errors. Resolved import errors with react and 'useState'. Updated react-dom with a const=root change in index.js.
useState was utilized
